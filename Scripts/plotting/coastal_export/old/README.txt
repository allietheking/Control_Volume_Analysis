plot_DIN_ocean_export_FR.py
	* Currently set up for FR bay runs. Plots DIN export out of the GG alongside inflow from the Delta
	* We might need to audit the way I set up inflow from the Delta (I tried to document in the script)
	* Also plots DIN export split into NO3 and NH4 constituents. 

plot_FullBay_WYComparison_Rates.py
